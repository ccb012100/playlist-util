# playlist-util

CLI utility for Syncing and Searching my Spotify album playlists created from [Playlister](https://github.com/ccb012100/playlister) and [playlist-search](https://github.com/ccb012100/playlist-search/)

## TODO

- Return Error if search term is empty
- Use [unicase](https://github.com/seanmonstar/unicase/pull/52) once [this issue](https://github.com/seanmonstar/unicase/pull/52) to add `UniCase::contains()` is completed.
